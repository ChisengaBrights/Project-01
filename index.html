        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>The dictionary definition of AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to 
            perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. It provides a vast spectrum of 
            activities that would fall into this category. At a basic level, AI automates tasks that 
            would require human intervention or decision making. This could be as simple as your video
             systems providing notification when an object appears in the field of view or more 
             complicated, like scanning through all your video to categorize the footage with red cars.</p>

        <h3>Theoretical Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Theoretical computer science is a subfield of computer science and mathematics that focuses
             on the abstract and mathematical foundations of computation. It is difficult to circumscribe 
             the theoretical areas precisely</p>

        <h3>Bitcoin</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Nodes in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network
             verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger, 
             called a blockchain, without central oversight.</p>

        <h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
        <p>The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
             Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described 
             as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, 
             [and] the most parodied work of art in the world".</p>

        <h3>Fern Plant</h3>
        <p>This lush and bountiful fern has actually been studied by NASA for its ability to purify the air.
             We’re not sure what space exploration has to do with plants, but we’ll trust NASA on this one.
              Boston Ferns are a powerhouse for removing compounds like plastics, formaldehyde, and smoke
               from the air. These toxic compounds get magically absorbed by the bushy leaves of the fern 
               and turned into materials that the plant can use for its own growth and wellbeing. Boston
                Ferns are well known for being easy to care for and bringing some lovely forest vibes into 
                your home, but they are also one of the top-ranking plants for offering wellness and health
                 benefits.</p>
